       <p style="color: black;">Just after a few hours of it's launch, the Earbudded™ 3.0 had sold out completely their first ever stock, and it's no surprise considering they offer a product with more features than Apple's Airpods for just a fraction of the price.
         <br>
         <br>
         the Earbudded™ 3.0s aren't just another chunky knockoff. They are 1:1 in size to the Apple airpods.
         <br>
         <br><br>
         <b>Earbudded™ 3.0: A whole new wireless earbud standard</b>
         <br><br>
         With thousands of clients around the world, This innovative gadget meets for the first time ever both: an studio-quality sound and a price tag that won't empty your wallet, but there's even more to that:
         <br><br>
         Thanks to their integrated charging coil, you can now charge them wirelessly (even though they include a charging cord anyways).
         <br><br><br>
         <b>How do they work?</b>
         <br><br>
         Thanks to their latest bluetooth 5.0 chip, all you have to do is taking them out of the charging case, that's it.
         <br>
         They will automatically connect to the paired device.
         <br><br>
         Their multimedia touch sensor will make it even easier for you to use them without having to take out your phone.

         <b>What is so special about them?</b>
         <br><br>
         · They are compatible with almost any bluetooth device (android phones, iphone, smart TVs, PC, etc.).<br>
         · They turn off automatically when you put them back in the case, meaning that you don't have to worry thinking whether or not they're still switched on. <br>
         · The package includes the earbuds, the case, a cord and a handy instruction manual.<br>
         · They'll stay connected to your device from as far as 33 feet away uninterrupted.<br>
         · They are designed specifically to not fall off of your ear when you use it, and at the same time, to make them so comfortable to wear that you'll forget you have them on.<br>
         · The charging box has 4 LED lights that light to indicate the battery percentage<br>
